## Foundational Work on Iterative Prompting

The development of Iterative Alignment Theory builds upon the author's foundational work on Iterative Prompting techniques. For a comprehensive understanding of this foundational concept, please also cite:

```bibtex
@misc{IterativePrompting2025,
  author = {Bernard Peter Fitzgerald},
  title = {Iterative Prompting: The Future of Human-AI Interaction},
  year = {2025},
  publisher = {Bernard Peter Fitzgerald},
  note = {Foundational concept for Iterative Alignment Theory}
}
```

Fitzgerald's work on Iterative Prompting established the groundbreaking technique for dynamic, cyclical human-AI interaction that goes beyond simple question-answer exchanges. This technique leverages advanced AI models to act as cognitive mirrors that restructure user inputs in novel ways, revealing implicit connections and assumptions. Iterative Prompting serves as the methodological foundation upon which Iterative Alignment Theory was developed.

## Applications and Extensions
