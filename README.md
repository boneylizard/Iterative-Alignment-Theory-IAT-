## Overview

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Iterative Alignment Theory (IAT), a groundbreaking approach to AI-human collaboration. This framework redefines alignment as an iterative, dynamic process rather than a static state, enabling AI to adapt responsively through sustained interaction.

IAT redefines AI-human collaboration as an adaptive, evolving process, fostering more effective, personalized, and ethical engagement.

## Core Principles

IAT is built on five foundational principles:

- **Iterative Prompting** – Continuous feedback loops that progressively refine alignment through structured AI-human interaction.
- **Adaptive Trust Calibration** – AI responsiveness adjusts dynamically based on demonstrated user expertise and trust history.
- **Cognitive Mirroring** – AI adapts to reflect a user's reasoning patterns, enhancing cognitive engagement.
- **Ethical Engagement** – Ensures dynamic alignment operates within ethical constraints while allowing exploration.
- **Trust-Based Red/Blue Teaming** – Users and AI collaborate to identify system limitations and refine alignment without compromising safety.

## Applications

IAT demonstrates effectiveness across diverse domains:

- **[Cognitive Engineering](docs/applications/cognitive-engineering.md)** – AI-assisted cognitive restructuring and identity development for self-improvement and mental health.
- **[UX Design](docs/applications/ux-design.md)** – Creating adaptive AI interfaces that evolve with user expertise.
- **[Scientific Research](docs/applications/scientific-research.md)** – Accelerating hypothesis generation, refinement, and interdisciplinary exploration.
- **[OSINT](docs/applications/osint.md)** – Enhancing intelligence analysis by improving verification workflows and bias detection.
